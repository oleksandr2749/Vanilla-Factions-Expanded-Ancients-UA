Was it man-made, or built by the gods themselves? We soon discovered that it was obviously the latter, as offerings made to the wondrous structure were magically catapulted to the heavens, and returned as something else entirely as a reward for our devotion.\n\nNote: You'll start poor and lack technology, but having the supply slingshot means it will be easier than a standard tribal start.</VFEA_CargoCult.description>
