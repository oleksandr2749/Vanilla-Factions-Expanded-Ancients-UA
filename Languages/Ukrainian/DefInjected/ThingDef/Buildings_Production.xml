  <VFEA_AncientHydroponicFarm.label>старовинний гідропонний басейн</VFEA_AncientHydroponicFarm.label>
  <VFEA_AncientHydroponicFarm.description>An artificial nutrient bath for growing plants. The nutrients pumps must work continuously; the plants will die if power is cut. Contains a set of built-in sun lamps.\n\nThis structure was built by a long forgotten civilisation and the technology can no longer be replicated. It will never suffer breakdowns, and it operates more efficiently during solar flare incidents.</VFEA_AncientHydroponicFarm.description>
